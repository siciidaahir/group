        <h1>New demographic shifts and employment trends</h1>
        <p>Traditionally a company would control how and where people work. Now that is changing dramatically; many people increasingly have more control and choose what they want to work on. Business paradigms have shifted in this direction; new companies like Uber usurp the taxi industry, and Airbnb puts the hotel industry under enormous pressure. The gig economy is growing too. Such changes are blurring the lines between employees and independent experts or freelancers who collaborate with the company.</p>
        <p>For the workplace of the future, we need to think differently about how to find the right person at the moment we need them. We also need to be agnostic to employment status   to accommodate employees and independent experts/freelancers. How to best access this pool of experts in a company’s network will become a strategic challenge.</p>
        <p>Given these new shifts and trends, HR must be at the centre of change to see how to bring on board the skills needed, whenever and wherever. Sir Ken Robinson reinforces this imperative. He stresses that only organisations providing environments which develop and uncover the full innovation and creativity of their people will survive in the future.</p>
        <p>Creativity and innovation have always been important, but what’s different is the context in which we live in today. Innovation is increasingly an outcome of collective effort and not individual geniuses as in the past. There is a need for collective creativity and innovation where each person counts and contributes, be it an employee or an external consultant.</p>
        <p>Jason Averbrook, a leading HR analyst, stated that HR must become “smart, bold and brave” to think about what kinds of rich employee experiences they can create to be compelling, just like our smart phones for us. However, many companies are still dealing with adoption challenges in HR issues.</p>
        <p>An international bank decided to review its performance management policies and discovered that employee preferences in performance management are much less aligned with country of origin and more with generation.</p>
