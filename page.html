        <h1>CEO's Message</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Serco!

As you navigate our website, I hope you learn more about the qualities that make our company an outstanding provider of essential government services and a wonderful place to build a career.

We provide service with a human touch.

We have earned the trust and respect of government customers for one simple reason—we have great people. They are experts in their fields. They bring a strong service ethos to everything they do. They take pride and ownership in the jobs they do. We bring passion, pride and experience together.</p>
        <p>We make a positive difference in people’s lives.

At Serco, we have earned a reputation for helping our government clients to transform the way in which citizens access government services. The programs we support are critical to keeping the nation secure, as well as making government services more efficient. From modernizing the Navy and supporting returning warriors to ensuring healthcare access and keeping the skies safe, Serco has earned a reputation for delivering on programs that truly make a difference.</p>
        <p>We have a client first philosophy.

We have only one objective: to ensure our clients mission objectives are achieved with the highest level of capability and assurance, and at the lowest possible cost. Our methodology ensures that vital government programs are stood up on time and on schedule. Serco’s clients come to us with confidence that we have the expertise to take service delivery to the next level of performance.</p>
        <p>We have true international reach.

We have worked in many of the most demanding and secure environments in the world, and our global reach means that we can support our clients wherever their needs require. As part of Serco Group plc, we are able to draw upon the accumulated knowledge of an organization that has set new standards of excellence in sectors including transportation, healthcare, and defense. We apply the very best international insights to keep our clients at the leading edge.</p>
        <p>We live out our values.

Serco’s corporate culture is defined by a simple set of corporate values that define how we operate every single day – Trust, Care, Innovation, and Pride. They reflect how we interact with our clients, our colleagues, and our communities. We hold each other accountable for creating a company we can all be proud to work at.

I hope this provides you with a few reasons to get to know Serco better. Whether you are a potential customer, a small business partner, or a future employee, we look forward to finding out how we can work together to bring service to life.</p>
        <p>The client and server we've described above don't tell the whole story. There are many other parts involved, and we'll describe them below.

For now, let's imagine that the web is a road. On one end of the road is the client, which is like your house. On the other end of the road is the server, which is a shop you want to buy something from.</p>
